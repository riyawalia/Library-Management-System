I implemented binary trees and objects/classes in the form of a library management system as I taught myself object oriented programming and Data Structures. 
Books and Dates of Issue are represented as objects. Books are stored in a binary tree, where the key value is an identification number unique to each code. The user can add books, view stored books, issue books and return books. 
This library management system was implemented using C++. 

You can run and execute this program here: http://cpp.sh/64cs
(Click on the execute tab and then click Run. You can enter input in the output console which is the white rectangle box at the bottom of the page.)
